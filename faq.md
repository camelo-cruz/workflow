# Frequently Asked Questions

This document is a collection of problems and solutions when running the scripts on the Phonetik Server at ZAS

## Python cannot be found

Error message: `Der Befehl "python" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden`

This problem should not occur anymore, since we installed Python 3.12.4 globally in the folder `C:\Programme\Python312`

You can check which Python file is used via `where python` on the command line

**Note** The Readme instructs you to type in `python3` - but this only works on MacOS and Linux. The Phonetik Server runs on Windows and hence just type `python` instead of `python3`

## Failed to import pytorch fbgemm.dll or one of its dependencies is missing

Sometimes installing the packages as described in the Readme fails. This is probably because of a problem in current versions of some Python package.

Workaround: Use Anaconda instead of Python virtual environments as follows:
* Install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) with the recommended options
* Add `C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Local\miniconda3\Scripts` to your Path environment variable (see below)
* Open a terminal window (`cmd`) 
* Run the command `conda init`
* Close and reopen the cmd shell again
* Run the command `conda create -n workflow`
* Run the command `conda activate workflow`
* Run the command `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
* Run the command `conda install -c conda-forge librosa`
* check if PyTorch works:
    * Type `python` to start the Python interpreter
    * type `import torch`
    * if there is no error, you have solved the problem
    * close the interpreter by typing `quit()`
 
Continue with the installation of the other packages required:
* Change into the directory where you checked out this git repo
* Run the command `python -m pip install -r requirments.txt` 


## [WinError 2] Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden 

The error message occurs when running the Python script `automatic_transcription.py`. The script starts processing the first `binaries` folder and stops with the error message that the specified file cannot be found. 

The error message is misleading - the script stops because Whisper cannot find the `ffmpeg.exe` binary.

Solution: Add the path `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to the `Path` environment variable. To do so, click on the Start menu and search for "Umgebungsvariablen". Open the search result "Umgebungsvariablen fÃ¼r dieses Konto bearbeiten", select "Path" in the top part of the screen, click on the Button "Bearbeiten", click on "Neu", click on "Durchsuchen", select the Directory  "Dieser PC" > "System (C:)" > "ffmpeg" > "bin" and close all dialogs by clicking on "OK".

**Note** you need to close the terminal window and start a new one for the Path variable to be updated.
